## Introduction to IDEs

### What is an IDE?
An **Integrated Development Environment (IDE)** is software that provides tools for writing, testing, and debugging code. It helps developers work more efficiently by combining multiple features like a text editor, debugger, and terminal in one place.

### History of IDEs
- In earlier times, developers used basic tools like **MS Word** and **Notepad** to write code. These tools lacked features to make coding easier. Over time, advanced IDEs were introduced to simplify coding and improve productivity.



- The first utility to speed up the development process was launched under the name of **Turbo Pascal** by **Borland Ltd**. This was the first software designed for developers containing an editor and compiler.

- While some claim the idea of an integrated development environment was ignited by Turbo Pascal, others say the first actual IDE in history was **Microsoft Visual Basic (VB)**, which was introduced in **1991**.

### Popular IDEs
Some of the most commonly used IDEs today are:

### Why Choose VS Code?
For beginners, **[VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)** is recommended. It is a powerful, lightweight, and user-friendly IDE with many extensions that make coding easier.

## Introduction to HTML

### What is HTML?
**HTML (HyperText Markup Language)** is the standard language used to create and design web pages. It structures the content of a webpage using elements called **tags**.

### History of HTML

**Tim Berners-Lee**, a physicist at the CERN research institute in Switzerland invented HTML in **1991**. This first version consisted of 18 HTML tages. Now, there are currently about 140 HTML tags, although not all of them are supported by modern browsers.

### HTML Structure
An HTML document has a basic structure that includes essential elements to define the content and metadata of a webpage. Here's an example:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <title>My First Webpage</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <h1>Welcome to HTML</h1>
    <p>This is a simple paragraph.</p>
  </body>
</html>
```

- **`<!DOCTYPE html>`**: Declares the document type and version of HTML.
- **`<html>`**: The root element that contains all HTML content.
- **`<head>`**: Contains metadata like title and character encoding.
- **`<meta>`**: Provides metadata about the document.
- **`<body>`**: Contains the visible content of the webpage.
- **Opening and Closing Tags**: Most HTML elements have an opening tag (e.g., `<p>`) and a closing tag (e.g., `</p>`).

### HTML Tags
Tags in HTML are enclosed in angle brackets `< >`. They are used to define the structure and style of content on a webpage. For example:

```html
<h1>This is a heading</h1>
<a href="https://example.com">This is a link</a>
```

### Commonly Used Tags
Here are some commonly used HTML tags:
- **Heading tags**: `<h1>` to `<h6>` for defining headings.
- **Anchor tag**: `<a>` for creating links.
- **Paragraph tag**: `<p>` for writing paragraphs.

Explore these tags and try creating a simple webpage with them.
