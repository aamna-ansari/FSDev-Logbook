## What is the Web?

- A system of interconnected documents and resources, linked by hyperlinks, and accessible over the internet.
- Websites and web apps are designed to provide content or services to users through web browsers.

## What is Web Development?
- The process of creating websites and web applications.
- Involves writing code to design, build, and maintain both the front-end and back-end of web applications.

## Websites and Web Apps
- **Websites**: Typically static, providing content like text, images, and links.
- **Web Apps**: Interactive and dynamic, allowing users to perform tasks like submitting forms, creating accounts, and processing payments.

## Breaking a Web App
- In this course, we'll break down web applications into smaller, manageable pieces to better understand their architecture.
- A web application typically consists of:
  - **Frontend**: The part of the application that users interact with, such as the user interface (UI).
  - **Backend**: The server-side logic that processes requests and handles data.
  - **Data Engineering**: Managing, structuring, and optimizing the data that flows between the backend and databases.
- A developer who can work on all these areas is called a **Full Stack Developer**.


## What is Full Stack Web Development?
- Full-stack development involves working on both the front-end (client-side) and back-end (server-side) of a web application.
- Full-stack developers handle everything from designing the user interface to managing databases and server-side code.

## How can you take the BEST out of this course?
- Stay engaged and ask questions when in doubt.
- Practice coding regularly â€” hands-on experience is crucial.
- Explore additional resources and tutorials for a deeper understanding.
- Collaborate with peers to share knowledge and grow together.
